    <h2>Maha Shivratri Puja Vidhi</h2>
    <p> There is an unknown and mysterious energy that is driving all of us. Scientists have not been able<br>
        
         to give it a name, yet. However, saints of yore have called this unknown energy Shiva.<br>

        Shiva is the energy believed to make every living being alive. We are able to breathe, <br>
        eat, walk and carry out our day-to-day activities because of Shiva. Not only does this <br>
        energy drive living beings, but it also resides in non-living things - as their energy.
         Shiva, thus, drives existence.</p>
